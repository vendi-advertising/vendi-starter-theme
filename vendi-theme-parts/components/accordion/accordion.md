# Accordion

An accordion is a list of headers that hide or reveal additional content when selected.

## Guidance

### When should you use an accordion?

- When you have a lot of content that you want to hide until the user wants to see it.

### When should you consider something else?

Accordions are sometimes used when a page feels like it is getting "too long".
