# Accordion

An accordion is a list of headers that hide or reveal additional content when selected.

## Guidance

### When should you use an accordion?

- When you have a lot of content that you want to hide until the user wants to see it
- When you have an easy scanable list of items where the contents are not needed to be seen all at once

### When should you consider something else?

- You think your page is getting "too long" and you want to hide content to make it appear shorter
