## Accordion

### Overview

The accordion component lets you display a list of headers that hide or reveal additional content when selected.  This makes content skimmable by headline or topic, enhancing the user experience with faster access to information and less scrolling. 

Use the accordion component when you want to:

* Present significant amounts information in a compact, efficient way:
    * Long sections/blocks of basic copy
    * Question & answer formatted content (as in FAQs)
    * Multiple files for download or links to other content
    * Images and/or videos
    * Forms
* Display a lot of content in a limited space (especially important for presentation on mobile devices)
* Provide users with clear access to key specific pieces of content within the context of a larger page

Choose a component other than accordion when:

* You want users to see most or all of the information on a page (use well-formatted text instead)
* You are presenting a small amount of content/not enough content to require condensing

Component options include:

* Choose one- or two-column style accordion
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
* Choose to set various text colors
* Choose to set various backgrounds
