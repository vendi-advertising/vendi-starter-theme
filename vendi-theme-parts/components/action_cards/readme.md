## Action Cards

### Overview

The action cards component lets you present and provide access to numerous related topics simultaneously (a
“collection”) in one place, enhancing the user experience with clear, direct access to individual pieces of essential
information or tasks. Cards stand apart from the larger page and from one another with a border, shadow, or background
color. Action cards live within a larger “deck,” and may be presented in any order.

Use the action cards component when you want to clearly present and provide access to related content that can also
stand alone, such as sections of your website, articles, and forms.

Choose a component other than action cards when you want to present:

* Simple, standalone content or simple calls to action (use a callout or simple call to action instead)
* A table or graphical content
* Sequential, continuous text—cards should stand alone and provide access to self-contained information

Component options include:

* Choose one- to five-card display
* Add an optional heading
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
* Choose to set various text colors
* Choose to set various backgrounds
* Link to a URL, post, or term, then choose whether to open target destination in a new tab
* Reorder cards after entry
