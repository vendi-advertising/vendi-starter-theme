# Basic Copy

## Overview

The _Basic Copy_ represents a very basic block of text. Text within this block can be structured with headers
(h1 though h6), paragraphs, lists (bulleted and numeric), and links. Images may also be used within this component,
however it is recommended to use more specific components such as _Figure_ which offer more control over the image.
