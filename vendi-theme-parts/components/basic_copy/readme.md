## Basic Copy

### Overview

This “go-to” component is ideal for presenting a block of content/information with an optional related headline and/or related subheads. Content presented in the basic copy component may be formatted (bolded, italicized, underlined, etc.) for clarity and ease of reading.

* Links to content or email addresses within text

Choose a component other than basic copy when you’re presenting:

* Text with an accompanying image
* Text not in paragraph or list format
* Brief text that needs to stand out such as a callout, testimonial, or statistic

Component options include:

* Add an optional heading (typically H2)
* Add optional subheadings in various sizes (H3-H6)
* Bold or italicize text
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
