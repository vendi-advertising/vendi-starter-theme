## Block Quote

### Overview

This component is ideal for featuring an impactful or important quotation from a member or other person.

Use the block quote component to:

* Enhance content with a related/supporting quotation
* Break up long blocks of copy/content
* Add visual interest to a page

Choose a component other than block quote when you want to:

* Present a lengthy testimonial (use the testimonial component or basic copy component with well-formatted text)
* Add content that is not a quotation

Component options include:

* Add an optional heading (typically H2)
* Bold or italicize text
* Link to a URL or existing content, then choose whether to open target destination in a new tab
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
* Choose to set various text colors
* Choose to set various backgrounds
