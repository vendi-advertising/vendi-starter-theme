## Callout

### Overview

The callout component is ideal for highlighting/calling out a small amount of relevant and/or impactful information
within a page of copy, then providing the user with a related call to action clearly and easily accessible via an
adjacent button. The callout component also allows inclusion of an optional photo or image.

Use the callout component to:

* Highlight a key piece of information accompanied by one or more text links or call-to-action buttons to inspire
  further interaction
* Complement this key information with a photo or image
* Add visual variety to a page and/or separate long copy blocks

Choose a component other than the callout component when the information you wish to present is lengthy and/or does not
have related calls to action.

Component options include:

* Add an optional heading (typically H2)
* Bold or italicize text
* Link to a URL or existing content, then choose whether to open target destination in a new tab
* Set content width to full (default without photo), narrow (default with photo), or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
* Choose to display a related photo or image at left or right of callout
* Choose to set various text colors
* Choose to set various button colors/styles
* Choose to set various backgrounds
