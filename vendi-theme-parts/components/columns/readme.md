## Columns

### Overview

The columns component is similar to the callout component in that it is used to highlight/call out small amounts of
relevant and/or impactful information (and optional related images and related call-to-action buttons for further
engagement) within a page of copy. Unlike the callout component, however, the columns component displays 1-4 columns,
each containing a single component. Think of the columns component as a “file drawer” for components presenting small
amounts of information, each in its own “folder.”

Use the columns component to:

* Provide an array of related information that is also capable of standing alone
* Complement information with imagery or photographs
* Break up long blocks of copy and/or add visual variety to a page

Choose a component other than columns when you want to:

* Present a single piece of impactful content (the callout component is a better choice)

Component options include:

* Add an optional component heading (typically H2)
* Add 1-4 columns, each with an optional heading
* Bold or italicize text
* Link to a URL or existing content, then choose whether to open target destination in a new tab
* Set content width to full, narrow, or slim
* Set vertical padding from None-XLarge (Medium is default)
* Choose to set various text sizes and colors
* Choose to set various button colors/styles
* Choose to set various backgrounds
