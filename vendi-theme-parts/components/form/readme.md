## Form

### Overview

The form component lets you add specific forms (contact, request additional information, etc.) to the website. Before
you can use this component, you must first build and add forms individually using WordPress’ Forms menu. Once you’ve
added one or more forms, use the form component to select one for display. Think of the form component as a “shelf” that
holds a selected individual form you’ve already added to WordPress.

Use the form component when you want to display a form that:

* Invites users to contact you for a direct response or other result
* Gathers user information for future use/contact

Choose a component other than form when you are adding content that is not a form.

Component options let you choose to:

* Add optional introductory copy to a form
* Add a heading to the form
* Display form title and description
* Use AJAX functionality (allows the form to be submitted without requiring a page refresh)
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from None-XLarge (Medium is default)
* Set various text colors
* Set various backgrounds
