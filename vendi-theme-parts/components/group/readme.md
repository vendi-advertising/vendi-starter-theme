## Group

### Overview

**This description should be updated. The group component is used to group one or more components together in order
to share a common background.**

With the group component, you can display a collection/group of buttons that allow users to perform related actions.
Buttons should contain brief copy (a heading and, if needed for clarity, a supporting phrase or sentence).

Use the group component to present:

* Information that inspires related actions (such as with a form that allows users to choose a primary or
  secondary/alternative action)
* Direction through linear content, such as “Back, Next, Continue, Skip, Cancel”

Choose a component other than group when you want to:

* Present users the opportunity to perform actions that are not related or contradictory (to prevent input mistakes)
* Link to content (use text links instead)

Component options include:

* Add optional introductory copy to button group
* Add a heading to the button group
* Set various text colors
* Set various backgrounds
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set vertical padding from None-XLarge (Medium is default)
