## Group

### Overview

The group component allows you to combine two or more components (ideally components with related content) on a single background, such as a basic copy component and a cards component.

Use the group component to:

* Enhance the flow, presentation, and readability of a page with a common, consistent background

Choose a component other than group when you want to:

* Present stand-alone information
* Break up your page presentation with varied backgrounds

Component options include:

* Choose your components
* Add a heading and set its style and text wrapping
* Choose to set various text colors
* Choose to set various background color and/or image or design
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set content vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
