# Image Gallery

## Overview

With the image gallery component, you can display a collection/group of images or photos in a single area. Images in the
gallery typically relate to one another. Before you can use this component, you must first add images to WordPress’
Media menu. Once you’ve added the images, use the image gallery component to select them for display. Think of the image
gallery component as a “shelf” that holds selected images you’ve already added to WordPress.

Use the image gallery component when you want to present imagery or photos that illustrate a common theme (such as
committee members, a category of products, etc.)

Choose a component other than image gallery when you want to add text, forms, or other non-image content to the site.

Component options include:

* Add a heading to the image gallery
* Set various text colors
* Set various backgrounds
* Choose to display a maximum of eight images across
* Choose to set a gap between images from 0-10 rems
* Set image fitting to scale-down (default), cover, contain, fill, or none
* Choose to add a caption and/or a title to images
* Choose to enable (default) or disable Lightbox
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set content vertical padding from None-XLarge (Medium is default)
