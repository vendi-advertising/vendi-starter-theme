## Reusable Content

### Overview

With the reusable content component, you can easily add identical content to numerous pages throughout your website.
Reusable content could be business hours, a specific services list, a photo with accompanying description/caption, a
disclaimer, etc.

Think of this component as a “shelf” that holds individual pieces of content from which you can select one for page
placement after adding the content pieces via WordPress’ Reusable Content menu. After you’ve added and saved a piece of
reusable content (using the appropriate component or combination of components), use the reusable content component to
select it for display it on several pages.

After you’ve saved your content to be repeated/reused via the Reusable Content menu, you’ll need to navigate to the
individual website pages in which you’d like it to display. While editing a web page, use the reusable content component
to select your desired piece of content for display. The component allows you to select only one piece of content at a
time.

Choose a component other than reusable content for any content that belongs on one webpage only.
