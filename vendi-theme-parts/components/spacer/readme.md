### Spacer

### Overview

Use the spacer component to add white space/empty space above or below other components. Spacers can enhance readability by breaking up page content, clearly indicating new sections of content/new subject matter and making pages more scannable and digestible overall. Avoid using several adjacent spacers; ideally, use just one before and/or after a component. Too much white/empty space on a page leads to unnecessary scrolling and may cause viewers to miss information.

Component options include:

* Choose content vertical padding from XXSmall-XLarge (Medium is default)
