## Testimonial

### Overview

With the testimonial component, you can easily add and highlight an impactful/remarkable testimonial/quotation on a web
page. Before you can use this component, you must first add testimonials individually using WordPress’ Testimonials
menu. Once you’ve added one or more testimonials, use the testimonial component to select one for display (you may
select only one testimonial at a time). Think of the form component as a “shelf” that holds a selected individual
testimonial you’ve already added to WordPress. Although the component allows you to select just one testimonial at a
time, you can add multiple testimonials to a page, either together/sequentially or between other components.

Use the testimonial component to:

* Illustrate IANA’s real-world impact with a relatively short testimonial related to page content
* Add visual interest to website pages and break up long blocks of content

Choose a component other than testimonial when you are presenting information that does not include a testimonial/quote,
or when you want to highlight a lengthy testimonial (either choose an excerpt from the longer testimonial or use a basic
copy block with properly formatted content to present the longer testimonial).

Component options include:

* Choose to add a heading to the testimonial
* Set various text colors
* Set various backgrounds
* Set content width to full (default), narrow, or slim
* Set content placement to left (default) or middle
* Set content vertical padding from None-XLarge (Medium is default)
